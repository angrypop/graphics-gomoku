1.Naming
  Name of variables and functions shall be an English word or combination of several words.
  Capitalize first letter(s), but with exceptions: all upper case for constants and all lower case for temporary variables.
  If the name is too long (approximately 20 letters), abbreviate it with common abbreviations.
  If a variable is global, add prefix 'g'.
  
  Examples:
    Recommended:  Count SaveGame InitializeGame/InitGame CalculateAverageScore/CalAvgSco gTotalScore PI temp i
    Poor:         kk shijian svgm Calculate_Score SetGlobalGameModeAsAIvsAI

2.Comments
  Write comments with characters within ASCII table only.(Mainly English alphabet, numbers, and commmonly used punctuations)
  If commenting in English is challenging for you, use PinYin.
  Use /* */ instead of //. (Some old C standards and compilers don't support)
  
  Examples:
    /* ... */
    /*
      ...
      ...
      ...
    */
